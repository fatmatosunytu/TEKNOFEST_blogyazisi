This study explores two distinct scenarios for stroke detection, classification, and segmentation, utilizing 6951 brain CT images from the TEKNOFEST competition. In both scenarios, CT images undergo preprocessing steps involving skull-stripping, normalization, and image augmentation. In the first scenario, stroke presence-absence classification achieved a 98% success rate on test images. Subsequent segmentation of images with strokes resulted in Dice scores of 59% for ischemic stroke and 67% for hemorrhagic stroke on test images. The classification of stroke types as ischemic and hemorrhagic achieved a 100% success rate, with a 97% success rate when directly classifying stroke types in images without segmentation. This indicates a 3% performance improvement when applying the classification process after stroke region segmentation. In the second scenario, a three-class classification of no stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke achieved an average of 97% success on test images. Post-classification, separately created models for the segmentation of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes yielded Dice scores of 78% and 79%, respectively. The second scenario demonstrated a performance improvement of 19% and 12% for the segmentation of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes through the post-classification segmentation process. The proposed approach outperforms competing teams in the competition rankings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brain Stroke; Ct; Deep Learning; Stroke Classification; Stroke Segmentation; Brain; Classification (of Information); Computerized Tomography; Image Classification; Image Enhancement; Image Segmentation; Medical Imaging; Brain Strokes; Ct; Ct Image; Deep Learning; Hemorrhagic Stroke; Ischemic Strokes; Performance; Stroke Classification; Stroke Segmentation; Test Images","","","","Stroke Turkish Neurological Society; Wang, Shuqiang, Brain stroke lesion segmentation using consistent perception generative adversarial network, Neural Computing and Applications, 34, 11, pp. 8657-8669, (2022); Zhang, Yue, MI-UNet: Multi-Inputs UNet Incorporating Brain Parcellation for Stroke Lesion Segmentation from T1-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Images, IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 25, 2, pp. 526-535, (2021); The Relationship of Venous Blood Lactate Levels with the Prognosis in Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke Patients Specialization Thesis in Medicine Department of Emergency Medicine Eskisehir Osmangazi University Eskisehir Turkey 2016; Tomasetti, Luca, Machine Learning Algorithms Versus Thresholding to Segment Ischemic Regions in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke, IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 26, 2, pp. 660-672, (2022); Sacco, Ralph L., An updated definition of stroke for the 21st century: A statement for healthcare professionals from the American heart association/American stroke association, Stroke, 44, 7, pp. 2064-2089, (2013); Liu, Jinzhen, Review of microwave imaging algorithms for stroke detection, Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing, 61, 10, pp. 2497-2510, (2023); Guo, Lei, Stroke Diagnosis Using Microwave Techniques: Review of Systems and Algorithms, IEEE Journal of Electromagnetics, RF and Microwaves in Medicine and Biology, 7, 2, pp. 122-135, (2023); Soltanpour, Mohsen, Ischemic stroke lesion prediction in CT perfusion scans using multiple parallel u-nets following by a pixel-level classifier, pp. 957-963, (2019); Mansour, R.

This manuscript aimed to comprehensively present the methodologies for data preparation, annotation procedures, and rigorous evaluation metrics. Moreover, it was conducted to introduce a meticulously curated abdominal emergencies data set to the researchers. Methods: The data set underwent a comprehensive central screening procedure employing diverse algorithms extracted from the e-Nabız (Pulse) and National Teleradiology System of the Republic of Türkiye, Ministry of Health. Full anonymization of the data set was conducted. Subsequently, the data set was annotated by a group of ten experienced radiologists. The evaluation process was executed by calculating F<inf>1</inf> scores, which were derived from the intersection over union values between the predicted bounding boxes and the corresponding ground truth (GT) bounding boxes. The establishment of baseline performance metrics involved computing the average of the highest five F<inf>1</inf> scores. Results: Observations indicated a progressive decline in F<inf>1</inf> scores as the threshold value increased. Furthermore, it could be deduced that class 6 (abdominal aortic aneurysm/dissection) was relatively straightforward to detect compared to other classes, with class 5 (acute diverticulitis) presenting the most formidable challenge. It is noteworthy, however, that if all achieved outcomes for all classes were considered with a threshold of 0.5, the data set’s complexity and associated challenges became pronounced. Conclusion: This data set’s significance lies in its pioneering provision of labels and GT-boxes for six classes, fostering opportunities for researchers. Clinical relevance statement: The prompt identification and timely intervention in cases of emergent medical conditions hold paramount significance. The handling of patients’ care can be augmented, while the potential for errors is minimized, particularly amidst high caseload scenarios, through the application of AI. Key Points: • The data set used in artificial intelligence competition in healthcare (TEKNOFEST-2022) provides a 6-class data set of abdominal CT images consisting of a great variety of abdominal emergencies. • This data set is compiled from the National Teleradiology System data repository of emergency radiology departments of 459 hospitals. • Radiological data on abdominal emergencies is scarce in literature and this annotated competition data set can be a valuable resource for further studies and new AI models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abdomen; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Vision Systems; Emergencies; X-ray Tomography; Abdomen; Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm; Abdominal Aortic Dissection; Acute Diverticulitis; Adult; Algorithm; Anonymization; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Clinical Outcome; Computer Vision; Controlled Study; Deep Learning; Demographics; Digital Imaging And Communications In Medicine; Emergency; Female; Health Care; Human; Icd-10; Major Clinical Study; Male; Performance Indicator; Qualitative Research; Radiologist; Screening; Diagnostic Imaging; Information Processing; Abdomen; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Datasets As Topic; Emergencies; Humans","","","","Koc, Ural, Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Competition (TEKNOFEST-2021): Stroke Data Set, Eurasian Journal of Medicine, 54, 3, pp. 248-258, (2022); Dadeh, Ar Aishah, Factors associated with unfavorable outcomes in patients with acute abdominal pain visiting the emergency department, BMC Emergency Medicine, 22, 1, (2022); Cervellin, Gianfranco F., Epidemiology and outcomes of acute abdominal pain in a large urban Emergency Department: Retrospective analysis of 5,340 cases, Annals of Translational Medicine, 4, 19, (2016); Acute Abdomenstatpearls, (2025); Summers, Ronald M., Progress in fully automated abdominal CT interpretation, American Journal of Roentgenology, 207, 1, pp. 67-79, (2016); Birinci, Şuayip B., A Digital Opportunity for Patients to Manage Their Health: Turkey National Personal Health Record System (The e-Nabız), Balkan Medical Journal, 40, 3, pp. 215-221, (2023); van Leeuwen, Kicky Gerhilde, Artificial intelligence in radiology: 100 commercially available products and their scientific evidence, European Radiology, 31, 6, pp. 3797-3804, (2021); Li, Disen, A comprehensive survey on deep learning techniques in CT image quality improvement, Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing, 60, 10, pp. 2757-2770, (2022); Balogh, Zsolt Adam, Comparison of CT noise reduction performances with deep learning-based, conventional, and combined denoising algorithms, Medical Engineering and Physics, 109, (2022); Sandino, Christopher M., Upstream Machine Learning in Radiology, Radiologic Clinics of North America, 59, 6, pp. 967-985, (2021)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","09387994; 14321084","","EURAE","37947834","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176259067"

The system consists of both statistical and probabilistic models, used in the sign recognition and sequence generation phases. Linguistic, technical, and human–computer interaction-related challenges, which are usually not considered in publicly available sign-based recognition application programming interfaces and tools, are addressed in this study. The specifics of the AzSL are reviewed, feature selection strategies are evaluated, and a robust model for the translation of hand signs is suggested. The two-stage recognition model exhibits high accuracy during real-time inference. Considering the lack of a publicly available dataset with the benchmark, a new, comprehensive AzSL dataset consisting of 13,444 samples collected by 221 volunteers is described and made publicly available for the sign language recognition community. To extend the dataset and make the model robust to changes, augmentation methods and their effect on the performance are analyzed. A lexicon-based validation method used for the probabilistic analysis and candidate word selection enhances the probability of the recognized phrases. Experiments delivered 94% accuracy on the test dataset, which was close to the real-time user experience.

In this article, the data set preparation and competition processes were explained in detail; the anonymized and annotated data set is also provided via official website for further research. Materials and Methods: Data set recorded over the period covering 2019 and 2020 were centrally screened from the e-Pulse and Teleradiology System of the Republic of Türkiye, Ministry of Health using various codes and filtering criteria. The data set was anonymized. The data set was prepared, pooled, curated, and annotated by 7 radiologists. The training data set was shared with the teams via a dedicated file transfer protocol server, which could be accessed using private usernames and passwords given to the teams under a non-disclosure agreement signed by the representative of each team. Results: The competition consisted of 2 stages. In the first stage, teams were given 192 digital imaging and communications in medicine images that belong to 1 of 3 possible categories namely, hemorrhage, ischemic, or non-stroke. Teams were asked to classify each image as either stroke present or absent. In the second stage of the competition, qualifying 36 teams were given 97 digital imaging and communications in medicine images that contained hemorrhage, ischemia, or both lesions. Among the employed methods, Unet and DeepLabv3 were the most frequently observed ones. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence competitions in healthcare offer good opportunities to collect data reflect-ing various cases and problems. Especially, annotated data set by domain experts is more valuable. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Competition; Computer Vision; Data Set; Stroke","","","Funding: The authors declared that this study has received no financial support.","Sureci Uluslararas Tarih Arastrmalar Derg, (2020); Teknofest Official Website, (2021); Kirshner, Howard S., Management of Intracerebral Hemorrhage: Update and Future Therapies, Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports, 21, 10, (2021); Brott, Thomas G., Treatment of acute ischemic stroke, New England Journal of Medicine, 343, 10, pp. 710-722, (2000); Dyer, Tom, Validation of an artificial intelligence solution for acute triage and rule-out normal of non-contrast CT head scans, Neuroradiology, 64, 4, pp. 735-743, (2022); Wang, Xiyue, A deep learning algorithm for automatic detection and classification of acute intracranial hemorrhages in head CT scans, NeuroImage: Clinical, 32, (2021); Ginat, Daniel Thomas, Implementation of machine learning software on the radiology worklist decreases scan view delay for the detection of intracranial hemorrhage on CT, Brain Sciences, 11, 7, (2021); Rava, Ryan A., Assessment of an Artificial Intelligence Algorithm for Detection of Intracranial Hemorrhage, World Neurosurgery, 150, pp. e209-e217, (2021); Arab, Ali, A fast and fully-automated deep-learning approach for accurate hemorrhage segmentation and volume quantification in non-contrast whole-head CT, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020); Zhao, Xianjing, Deep learning shows good reliability for automatic segmentation and volume measurement of brain hemorrhage, intraventricular extension, and peripheral edema, European Radiology, 31, 7, pp. 5012-5020, (2021)","","AVES","","","","","","13088742; 13088734","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140252778"
